					<p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter and, in my opinion ,a genius mastermind. Her discography spans multiple genres and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and widespread media coverage(as it should). Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Tay moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a US platinum-certified album entirely(go tay-tay).

					Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to respectively top the US pop and all-genre airplay charts(they were also the best ones). She experimented with rock and electronic styles (iconic) on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country identity in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do"(best era fr).</p>
